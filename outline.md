## Session 4: JavaScript Basics - Adding Interactivity

*   **JavaScript Basics:** What JS is, where it runs (browser), adding JS to HTML (`<script>`).
*   **Variables and Operators:** Declaring variables (`let`, `const`, `var`), basic arithmetic and assignment operators.
*   **Data Types and Conditionals:** Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects (brief intro); `if`, `else if`, `else` statements.

*Note: The pace of Session 4 is ambitious. You may need to adjust which projects are fully completed in-session versus assigned as homework, or focus on getting the core JS/DOM concepts and one interactive example (like the RPS revisit) done well.*
